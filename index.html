<h1>What is thermodynamics?</h1>
<p>Thermodynamics is a study of effects of heat, work and energy on a system. It gives relation between pressure(P),volume(V) and temperature(T).</p>
<p1>There are four laws in the thermodynamics they are, </p1>
<ul>
<li>Zeroth law</li>
<li>First law</li>
<li>Second law</li>
<li>Third law</li>
</ul>
<h2>Zeroth law</h2>
<p>If the two bodies are each in thermal equilibrium with some third body then they are also in equilibrium with each other</p>
<h3>First law</h4>
<p>Change in the internal energy is equal to the difference of heat transfer into the system and workdone by the system. 
<p>dU = dQ - dW</p>
<h4>Perfect engine</h4>
<p>If a engine works with 100% efficiency, that is it converts all the heat energy in it to workdone is known as ideal or pefect engine.
