<h1>Perfect engine</h1>
<p>If a engine works with 100% efficiency, that is it converts all the heat energy in it to workdone is known as ideal or pefect engine. </p>
<h2>Carnot cycle</h2>
<img src="" alt="Carnot cycle diagram" width="80" height="90">
    <p>An ideal engine operating in a particularly simple cycle known as the carnot cycle.  During the cycle process of the engine, some of the heat is absorbed from a hotter reservoir in the isothermal expansion; during the another isothermal compression a small amount of heat is released to a cooler reservoir, So the efficiency of the engine is never goes 100%.Now there are four process in the carnot cycle they are reversible, the carnot engine is a reversible process</p>
<p>The four process are,</p>
<ul>
    <li>Isothermal expansion</li>
    <li>Adiabatic expansion</li>
    <li>Isothermal compression</li>
    <li>Adiabatic compression</li>
</ul>
<h3>Isothermal expansion</h3>
